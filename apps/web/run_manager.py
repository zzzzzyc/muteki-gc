"""RunManager — the web/TUI-facing handle to live solve runs.

The frontends are dumb subscribers (§3): they never call the solver core
directly. They ask the RunManager to start a run, subscribe to that run's
EventBus, and submit durable control commands. A narrow queue adapter preserves
the existing coordinator inbox without treating queueing as proof of effect.

A "run" here is one challenge being solved (solo or by a swarm). Each gets its
own EventBus + SessionStore (durable replay) + an asyncio.Queue for inbound
human commands.
