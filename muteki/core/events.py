"""Typed event schema — the single contract between the agent core and any frontend.

AG-UI-style ordered, typed event stream. Web and TUI are dumb subscribers; they
never call the core directly, they only subscribe to these events and post HITL.

Appendix A of the design doc, fleshed out with typed payload constructors so
producers don't hand-build dicts (which drift and break the frontend).
