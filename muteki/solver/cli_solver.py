"""CliSolver — a swarm worker whose EXECUTOR is a shelled CLI agent (claude/codex)
instead of the local code-driven kernel loop.

It is a drop-in for `Solver` in the swarm: same construction surface, same
`run() -> SolveOutcome`, same `solver_id` / `graph`, and it emits the same event
stream (RUN_STARTED → reasoning/insight → fact_added/flag_found → RUN_FINISHED) so
the deck, shared_graph, and blackboard telemetry keep working unchanged.

What's different: instead of driving an LLM through run_python tool-calls, it hands
the challenge to a CLI agent (full shell, its own agentic loop), then runs the SAME
provenance gate (`muteki.solver.gate.flag_ok`) on the agent's real output. The
moat is preserved — a flag still only counts if it traces to actual output.

Bare host (no isolation — user deferred P-D0). The CLI runs in a per-solver scratch
workdir; for a service challenge the agent only needs the target URL.

        observe → plan → execute → verify → reflect → checkpoint internally,
        ≤ turn_limit turns, re-planning every plan_every turns.

        - Belief state persists to <wd>/.shell/state.json after EVERY turn, so
          a crashed worker resumes from its last checkpoint instead of
          re-walking the recon chain (§7).
        - Verified checkpoints and SUB_INTENT= declarations are appended to the
          event bus; the central arbiter ingests them into its ledger (the
          central never ghost-writes worker state).
        - Stuck detection: stuck_limit consecutive turns with no new
          fact/dead-end/artifact → self-kill (§3 Stuck Detection).
        - Budget: the envelope's token/turn ceilings are enforced locally as a
          hard stop; the reported budget_signal lets the central Budget
          Enforcer cancel a runaway shell.
